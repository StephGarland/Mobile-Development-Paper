When I say thank you, I mean I adore you and when I say I adore you, I mean I will check your horoscope.\n\nI mean when you leave the balloons that you carry in your laughter behind on my ceiling, well, I like them better than flowers. My body is a garden rooted in gratitude. “Thank you” is the biggest poem I’ve got inside of me.</string>
